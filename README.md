# Stock-Price-Prediction-Model
This project uses machine learning models to predict the daily movement direction (up or down) and the actual next-day closing price of stock prices. Leveraging historical data from the yfinance library, it demonstrates the power of various classification and regression models, enhanced with feature engineering and visualizations.
